# Pablo A. Rodriguez MuÃ±oz

Computer science graduate and passionate about the area of software development since I have worked on different web projects during my college career. I have skills in backend with Spring Framework and in frontend with React and Express, always trying to improve in both areas.
I am a really good collaborator so whenever I work as a part of a team with other people I will work closely with them.
